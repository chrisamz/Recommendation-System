# Recommendation Systems

## Project Overview

This project aims to create a recommendation engine for an e-commerce platform to suggest products to users based on their browsing and purchase history. The recommendation system will utilize various machine learning techniques, including collaborative filtering, content-based filtering, matrix factorization, and neural networks, to provide personalized product recommendations.

## Components

### 1. Data Collection and Preprocessing
Collect and preprocess data related to user interactions on the e-commerce platform, including browsing history, purchase history, product details, and user information. Ensure the data is clean, consistent, and ready for analysis.

- **Data Sources:** User interactions (browsing and purchase history), product information (category, price, etc.), and user profiles (demographics, preferences).
- **Techniques Used:** Data cleaning, normalization, handling missing values, feature engineering.

### 2. Collaborative Filtering
Implement collaborative filtering techniques to recommend products based on the preferences of similar users.

- **Techniques Used:** User-based collaborative filtering, item-based collaborative filtering, k-nearest neighbors.

### 3. Content-Based Filtering
Develop content-based filtering models to recommend products similar to those the user has interacted with in the past.

- **Techniques Used:** TF-IDF, cosine similarity, feature extraction.

### 4. Matrix Factorization
Use matrix factorization techniques to decompose the user-item interaction matrix and identify latent features for recommendations.

- **Techniques Used:** Singular Value Decomposition (SVD), Alternating Least Squares (ALS).

### 5. Neural Networks
Leverage neural networks to create advanced recommendation models that can capture complex patterns in the data.

- **Techniques Used:** Deep learning, embeddings, autoencoders, neural collaborative filtering.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.8 or above
- Required libraries listed in `requirements.txt`

### Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/recommendation_systems.git
   cd recommendation_systems
   
2. Install the required packages:
   
   ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt

### Data Preparation
1. Place raw data files in the data/raw/ directory.
2. Run the data preprocessing script to prepare the data:
    ```bash
    python src/data_preprocessing.py
    
### Running the Notebooks
1. Launch Jupyter Notebook:
    ```bash
    jupyter notebook
    
2. Open and run the notebooks in the notebooks/ directory to process data, build models, and evaluate results:
 - data_preprocessing.ipynb
 - collaborative_filtering.ipynb
 - content_based_filtering.ipynb

 - neural_networks.ipynb
   
### Training Models
1. Train the collaborative filtering model:
    ```bash
    python src/collaborative_filtering.py
    
2. Train the content-based filtering model:
    ```bash
    python src/content_based_filtering.py
    
3. Train the matrix factorization model:
    ```bash
    python src/matrix_factorization.py
    
4. Train the neural network model:
    ```bash
    python src/neural_networks.py
    
### Results and Evaluation
 - Collaborative Filtering: Evaluate the performance using metrics such as Precision@K, Recall@K, and Mean Average Precision (MAP).
 - Content-Based Filtering: Measure the model's accuracy using metrics like Precision, Recall, and F1-score.
 - Matrix Factorization: Assess the model with Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) and Mean Absolute Error (MAE).
 - Neural Networks: Evaluate the deep learning models using metrics such as Precision, Recall, F1-score, and AUC-ROC.
